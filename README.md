# External_Instrument_VAR_Model:- Replicating Gertler-Karadi Proxy SVAR model

# Gertler & Karadi in their seminal paper https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20130329, 
have provided an evidence on the transmission of monetary policy shocks in a setting with both economic and financial variables. They show that shocks identified using high frequency surprises around policy announcements as external instruments produce responses in output and inflation that are typical in monetary VAR analysis. 
# I have tried to replicate the Gertler&Karadi approach to explain the effect of monetary surprises in case of Germany. 
# At present i have relicated the first model which is the simplest external instrument VAR model  and in time i will be adding the other model with Cholesky and Bootsrap method.

# In addition i will try to replicate the approach of Kanzig & Shousha
